# Goal: Write an Ansible role and playbook to prepare the server for operation

## Task: Prepare the OS using Ansible

Using Ansible, implement the ability to perform the following actions (and repeat them on other servers in the future):

- Implement the procedure of encrypting the second disk in the system (where there is no root partition) (partition name should be specified in the inventory).
- Implement a procedure to encrypt the partition that is present on the disk next to the root partition.
- Disable C-state for all available CPUs.
- Switch CPU operation from power-saving mode to more productive mode.
- Rename the active network interface to "net0". Display information about the renamed interface during the playbook.
- At the end of the playbook execution, a list of CPUs should be displayed, as well as information about Intel Hyper-Threading (AMD multithreading).

## General Requirements:

- When designing playbooks and roles, attention should be paid to error handling and correct task execution messages.
- Each playbook or role should be described in a separate README file along with startup and validation instructions.
- All required files (playbooks, roles, scripts) must be submitted along with the result of the assignment.

## Evaluation:

The candidate will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Quality of writing Ansible playbooks and roles.
- Overall code organization.
- Understanding of basic Ansible concepts and system administration.

After completing the assignment, please provide a git repository or archive of the roles, playbooks, and README files so that they can be evaluated and tested.
